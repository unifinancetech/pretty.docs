As a fully community-based project, unifinancetech will always be open.  
With no pre-mine, founder shares or VC-allocated tokens, everything will be distributed to the community, which will hold all the power over what to do with the protocol.

Just remember that it is your own duty to ensure the safety of your tokens and profits, so use at your own risk.

Join the governance and make it better.
